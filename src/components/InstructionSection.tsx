        How to Use the Color Match Filter Box Effectively
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Confidence begins with the right tones. Choosing the right personal
        color filter helps highlight your natural beautyâ€”whether you're trying
        on outfits or selecting makeup shades. The filter box above offers
        four seasonal palettes: Summer, Winter, Autumn, and Spring, each
        representing unique color characteristics tailored to your skin
        undertone.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Follow the steps below to find your ideal match:
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">
        Use Natural Lighting:
      </h3>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
        <li>
          Stand in front of a window or in a space with soft, natural
          daylight.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid harsh artificial lighting or colored lights that may alter
          how the filter appears on your skin.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">
        Make Sure Your Face is Clearly Visible:
      </h3>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
        <li>
          Remove anything that may block your face, such as masks, hats, or
          heavy bangs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tie your hair back if needed, especially if it shadows your face.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">
        Clean Face or Minimal Makeup Recommended:
      </h3>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 ml-4">
        <li>
          For the most accurate result, use the filter with a clean face or
          minimal makeup.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bold lipsticks or strong blush may interfere with how the filter
          adjusts to your natural tone.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">

          Notice how each palette affects your skin tone, eye color, and
          hair.

        <li>
          The right filter will brighten your features and make you look
          naturally radiant.
